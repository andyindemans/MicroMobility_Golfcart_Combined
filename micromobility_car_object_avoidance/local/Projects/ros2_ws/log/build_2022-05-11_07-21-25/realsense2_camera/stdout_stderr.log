CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:102 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddiagnostic_updater.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "diagnostic_updater", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "diagnostic_updater" with any of the following names:

    diagnostic_updaterConfig.cmake
    diagnostic_updater-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "diagnostic_updater" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "diagnostic_updater_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "diagnostic_updater" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
